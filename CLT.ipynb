    "\"You are a Business Analyst working for FedEx. A business client has a requested a large freight to be transported urgently from Denver to Salt Lake City. When asked about the weight of the cargo they could not supply the exact weight, however they have specified that there are a total of 36 boxes. From prior experience with this client you know that this type of cargo follows a distribution with mean of mu = 72 lb (32.66 kg) and std. dev of sigma = 3 lb (1.36 kg). The only plane you currently have at Denver is a Cessna 208B Grand Caravan with a max cargo weight of 2,630 lb (1,193 kg).\n",
